# WTWR - What to wear?

## What is it?

    This is a simple project designed to take the user's location and display the temperature, weather condition and clothing suggestions for going outside.

## Technology used?

    This project is the first of many that will use React. A blend of HTML, CSS, JS, including native and remote API calls. This particular API used in the project is OpenWeather API. This API returns quite a lot of information but this project only used the current temperature and weather condition based on what the user's location is.
